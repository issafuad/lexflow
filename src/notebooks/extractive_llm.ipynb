You need to change course urgently.\"\\n\\nMrs Braverman was sacked from her role on Monday, after opponents accused her of stoking tensions ahead of pro-Palestinian marches in London.\\n\\nShe lost her job days after she claimed police had applied a \"double standard\" to protesters, in an article for the Times newspaper.\\n\\nMrs Braverman said Mr Sunak had failed \"to rise to the challenge posed by the increasingly vicious antisemitism and extremism displayed on our streets\".\\n\\n\"I have become hoarse urging you to consider legislation to ban the hate marches and help stem the rising tide of racism, intimidation and terrorist glorification threatening community cohesion,\" she added, accusing the PM of putting off \"tough decisions in order to minimise political risk to yourself\".\\n\\n\\'Tory psychodrama\\'\\nIn her letter, Mrs Braverman said the conditions under which she agreed to become home secretary in October 2022 were set out in a \"document with clear terms\".\\n\\nSources close to Mrs Braverman claim Mr Sunak read and agreed the document the letter refers to, which had been drawn up by Mrs Braverman.\\n\\nThey say he took a copy and there were witnesses.\\n\\nMrs Braverman said the agreement included \"firm assurances\" on cutting legal migration, inserting measures to override the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into legislation to stop small boat crossings, delivering key Brexit legislation and issuing \"unequivocal\" guidance to schools on protecting biological sex and safeguarding single-sex spaces.\\n\\nShe accused Mr Sunak of \"a betrayal of our agreement\" and \"a betrayal of your promise to the nation that you would do \\'whatever it takes\\' to stop the boats\".\\n\\nLabour shadow minister Lisa Nandy said the letter was \"just the latest instalment in a Tory psychodrama that\\'s been playing out over the last 13 years, holding the rest of the country to ransom while the Tories fight among themselves\".'"
